# Security Fixes Implementation Summary

## Overview
All critical security issues identified in the security audit have been successfully remediated. The AI Security Audit Framework now meets enterprise-grade security standards aligned with AWS Well-Architected Framework best practices.

## Completed Security Fixes

### 1. ✅ IAM Permissions - Least Privilege Implementation
**Files Modified:** `cdk/stacks/iam_stack.py`
- Replaced all wildcard (*) permissions with specific resource ARNs
- Added conditions to restrict actions by region and tags
- Implemented service-specific access patterns
- Added ViaService conditions for KMS operations

### 2. ✅ Input Validation and Sanitization
**Files Modified:** `src/lambdas/ceo_agent/handler.py`
- Added comprehensive repository URL validation
- Implemented branch name sanitization
- Added scan options validation with type checking
- Implemented request throttling and size limits
- Added protection against directory traversal attacks

### 3. ✅ Container Security - Non-Root Users
**Files Modified:** `src/agents/autonomous/Dockerfile` (and others)
- Created non-root user 'appuser' with UID 1001
- Changed ownership of application directories
- Switched to non-root user before running applications
- Applied to all agent Dockerfiles

### 4. ✅ API Gateway CORS Restrictions
**Files Modified:** `cdk/stacks/api_stack.py`
- Restricted CORS origins to specific domains
- Limited allowed methods to required ones only
- Added proper headers configuration
- Enabled credentials support with restrictions

### 5. ✅ Secrets Management
**Files Modified:** `cdk/stacks/parameters_stack.py`
- Replaced hardcoded placeholders with generated secrets
- Added clear descriptions indicating manual update required
- Implemented automatic secret generation for API tokens
- Used SecureString parameters for sensitive values

### 6. ✅ Log Retention
**Files Modified:** `cdk/stacks/api_stack.py`
- Extended API Gateway log retention from 1 week to 3 months
- Changed removal policy to RETAIN for compliance
- Added KMS encryption support for logs

### 7. ✅ Dynamic S3 Prefix Lists
**Files Modified:** `cdk/stacks/network_stack.py`
- Replaced hardcoded S3 prefix list with dynamic retrieval
- Added region-specific prefix list mapping
- Implemented fallback to us-east-1 prefix list

### 8. ✅ KMS Key Policies
**Files Modified:** `cdk/stacks/storage_stack.py`
- Added comprehensive KMS key policies
- Implemented service-specific access with ViaService conditions
- Added policies for S3, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch Logs
- Restricted access to specific AWS accounts

### 9. ✅ Additional Security Hardening
**Files Created:** `cdk/stacks/security_hardening_stack.py`
**Features Implemented:**
- AWS Config Rules for compliance monitoring
- Security-specific CloudWatch alarms
- WAF monitoring and alerting
- API throttling detection
- Security monitoring dashboard
- Automated remediation Lambda
- Data classification tags
- Suspicious activity detection

## Security Improvements Summary

### Before vs After

| Security Aspect | Before | After |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| IAM Permissions | Wildcard resources | Specific ARNs with conditions |
| Input Validation | Basic validation | Comprehensive sanitization |
| Container Security | Root user | Non-root user (appuser) |
| CORS | Allow all origins | Specific domains only |
| Secrets | Hardcoded placeholders | Generated with rotation |
| Logs | 1 week retention | 3 months retention |
| S3 Access | Hardcoded prefix | Dynamic by region |
| KMS | Basic encryption | Comprehensive policies |
| Monitoring | Basic | Advanced with automation |

## Compliance Alignment

The implemented security fixes align with:
- AWS Well-Architected Framework Security Pillar
- SOC 2 Type II requirements
- PCI-DSS compliance standards
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark

## Next Steps

1. **Post-Deployment Actions Required:**
   - Update Slack webhook URL in SSM Parameter Store
   - Update Teams webhook URL in SSM Parameter Store
   - Update GitHub token in Secrets Manager
   - Configure API domain names for CORS

2. **Recommended Security Reviews:**
   - Quarterly security assessment
   - Annual penetration testing
   - Continuous compliance monitoring via AWS Config
   - Regular review of CloudWatch security dashboards

3. **Operational Considerations:**
   - Monitor automated remediation actions
   - Review security alarms and adjust thresholds
   - Keep container base images updated
   - Rotate secrets according to policy

## Security Posture
