This library provides constructs for Python Lambda functions.

To use this module, you will need to have Docker installed.

## Python Function

Define a `PythonFunction`:

```python
python.PythonFunction(self, "MyFunction",
    entry="/path/to/my/function",  # required
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,  # required
    index="my_index.py",  # optional, defaults to 'index.py'
    handler="my_exported_func"
)
```

All other properties of `lambda.Function` are supported, see also the [AWS Lambda construct library](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/tree/main/packages/aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda).

## Python Layer

You may create a python-based lambda layer with `PythonLayerVersion`. If `PythonLayerVersion` detects a `requirements.txt`
or `Pipfile` or `poetry.lock` with the associated `pyproject.toml` at the entry path, then `PythonLayerVersion` will include the dependencies inline with your code in the
layer.

Define a `PythonLayerVersion`:

```python
python.PythonLayerVersion(self, "MyLayer",
    entry="/path/to/my/layer"
)
```

A layer can also be used as a part of a `PythonFunction`:

```python
python.PythonFunction(self, "MyFunction",
    entry="/path/to/my/function",
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
    layers=[
        python.PythonLayerVersion(self, "MyLayer",
            entry="/path/to/my/layer"
        )
    ]
)
```

## Packaging

If `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile` or `poetry.lock` exists at the entry path, the construct will handle installing all required modules in a [Lambda compatible Docker container](https://gallery.ecr.aws/sam/build-python3.7) according to the `runtime` and with the Docker platform based on the target architecture of the Lambda function.

Python bundles are only recreated and published when a file in a source directory has changed.
Therefore (and as a general best-practice), it is highly recommended to commit a lockfile with a
list of all transitive dependencies and their exact versions. This will ensure that when any dependency version is updated, the bundle asset is recreated and uploaded.

To that end, we recommend using [`pipenv`] or [`poetry`] which have lockfile support.

* [`pipenv`](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html#example-pipfile-lock)
* [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control)

Packaging is executed using the `Packaging` class, which:

1. Infers the packaging type based on the files present.
2. If it sees a `Pipfile` or a `poetry.lock` file, it exports it to a compatible `requirements.txt` file with credentials (if they're available in the source files or in the bundling container).
3. Installs dependencies using `pip`.
4. Copies the dependencies into an asset that is bundled for the Lambda package.

**Lambda with a requirements.txt**

```plaintext
.
├── lambda_function.py # exports a function named 'handler'
├── requirements.txt # has to be present at the entry path
```

**Lambda with a Pipfile**

```plaintext
.
├── lambda_function.py # exports a function named 'handler'
├── Pipfile # has to be present at the entry path
├── Pipfile.lock # your lock file
```

**Lambda with a poetry.lock**

```plaintext
.
├── lambda_function.py # exports a function named 'handler'
├── pyproject.toml # your poetry project definition
├── poetry.lock # your poetry lock file has to be present at the entry path
```

**Excluding source files**

You can exclude files from being copied using the optional bundling string array parameter `assetExcludes`

```python
python.PythonFunction(self, "function",
    entry="/path/to/poetry-function",
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
    bundling=python.BundlingOptions(
        # translates to `rsync --exclude='.venv'`
        asset_excludes=[".venv"]
    )
)
```

## Custom Bundling

Custom bundling can be performed by passing in additional build arguments that point to index URLs to private repos, or by using an entirely custom Docker images for bundling dependencies. The build args currently supported are:

* `PIP_INDEX_URL`
* `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL`
* `HTTPS_PROXY`

Additional build args for bundling that refer to PyPI indexes can be specified as:

```python
entry = "/path/to/function"
image = DockerImage.from_build(entry)

python.PythonFunction(self, "function",
    entry=entry,
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
    bundling=python.BundlingOptions(
        build_args={"PIP_INDEX_URL": "https://your.index.url/simple/", "PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL": "https://your.extra-index.url/simple/"}
    )
)
```

If using a custom Docker image for bundling, the dependencies are installed with `pip`, `pipenv` or `poetry` by using the `Packaging` class. A different bundling Docker image that is in the same directory as the function can be specified as:

```python
entry = "/path/to/function"
image = DockerImage.from_build(entry)

python.PythonFunction(self, "function",
    entry=entry,
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
    bundling=python.BundlingOptions(image=image)
)
```

You can set additional Docker options to configure the build environment:

```python
entry = "/path/to/function"

python.PythonFunction(self, "function",
    entry=entry,
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
    bundling=python.BundlingOptions(
        network="host",
        security_opt="no-new-privileges",
        user="user:group",
        volumes_from=["777f7dc92da7"],
        volumes=[DockerVolume(host_path="/host-path", container_path="/container-path")]
    )
)
```

## Custom Bundling with Code Artifact

To use a Code Artifact PyPI repo, the `PIP_INDEX_URL` for bundling the function can be customized (requires AWS CLI in the build environment):

```python
from child_process import exec_sync


entry = "/path/to/function"
image = DockerImage.from_build(entry)

domain = "my-domain"
domain_owner = "111122223333"
repo_name = "my_repo"
region = "us-east-1"
code_artifact_auth_token = exec_sync(f"aws codeartifact get-authorization-token --domain {domain} --domain-owner {domainOwner} --query authorizationToken --output text").to_string().trim()

index_url = f"https://aws:{codeArtifactAuthToken}@{domain}-{domainOwner}.d.codeartifact.{region}.amazonaws.com/pypi/{repoName}/simple/"

python.PythonFunction(self, "function",
    entry=entry,
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
    bundling=python.BundlingOptions(
        environment={"PIP_INDEX_URL": index_url}
    )
)
```

The index URL or the token are only used during bundling and thus not included in the final asset. Setting only environment variable for `PIP_INDEX_URL` or `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` should work for accesing private Python repositories with `pip`, `pipenv` and `poetry` based dependencies.

If you also want to use the Code Artifact repo for building the base Docker image for bundling, use `buildArgs`. However, note that setting custom build args for bundling will force the base bundling image to be rebuilt every time (i.e. skip the Docker cache). Build args can be customized as:

```python
from child_process import exec_sync


entry = "/path/to/function"
image = DockerImage.from_build(entry)

domain = "my-domain"
domain_owner = "111122223333"
repo_name = "my_repo"
region = "us-east-1"
code_artifact_auth_token = exec_sync(f"aws codeartifact get-authorization-token --domain {domain} --domain-owner {domainOwner} --query authorizationToken --output text").to_string().trim()

index_url = f"https://aws:{codeArtifactAuthToken}@{domain}-{domainOwner}.d.codeartifact.{region}.amazonaws.com/pypi/{repoName}/simple/"

python.PythonFunction(self, "function",
    entry=entry,
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
    bundling=python.BundlingOptions(
        build_args={"PIP_INDEX_URL": index_url}
    )
)
```

## Command hooks

It is  possible to run additional commands by specifying the `commandHooks` prop:

```python
entry = "/path/to/function"
python.PythonFunction(self, "function",
    entry=entry,
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
    bundling=python.BundlingOptions(
        command_hooks={
            # run tests
            def before_bundling(self, input_dir):
                return ["pytest"],
            def after_bundling(self, input_dir):
                return ["pylint"]
        }
    )
)
```

The following hooks are available:

* `beforeBundling`: runs before all bundling commands
* `afterBundling`: runs after all bundling commands

They all receive the directory containing the dependencies file (`inputDir`) and the
directory where the bundled asset will be output (`outputDir`). They must return
an array of commands to run. Commands are chained with `&&`.

The commands will run in the environment in which bundling occurs: inside the
container for Docker bundling or on the host OS for local bundling.

## Docker based bundling in complex Docker configurations

By default the input and output of Docker based bundling is handled via bind mounts.
In situtations where this does not work, like Docker-in-Docker setups or when using a remote Docker socket, you can configure an alternative, but slower, variant that also works in these situations.

```python
entry = "/path/to/function"

python.PythonFunction(self, "function",
    entry=entry,
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
    bundling=python.BundlingOptions(
        bundling_file_access=BundlingFileAccess.VOLUME_COPY
    )
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Containerfile: no such file or directory

If you are on a Mac, using [Finch](https://github.com/runfinch/finch) instead of Docker, and see an error
like this:

```txt
lstat /private/var/folders/zx/d5wln9n10sn0tcj1v9798f1c0000gr/T/jsii-kernel-9VYgrO/node_modules/@aws-cdk/aws-lambda-python-alpha/lib/Containerfile: no such file or directory
```

That is a sign that your temporary directory has not been mapped into the Finch VM. Add the following to `~/.finch/finch.yaml`:

```yaml
additional_directories:
  - path: /private/var/folders/
  - path: /var/folders/
```

Then restart the Finch VM by running `finch vm stop && finch vm start`.

        :param environment: The environment variables to pass to the container. Default: - no environment variables.
        :param network: Docker `Networking options <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#connect-a-container-to-a-network---network>`_. Default: - no networking options

        :param user: The user to use when running the container. Default: - root or image default
        :param volumes: Docker volumes to mount. Default: - no volumes are mounted
        :param volumes_from: Where to mount the specified volumes from. Default: - no containers are specified to mount volumes from
        :param working_directory: Working directory inside the container. Default: - image default
        :param asset_excludes: (experimental) List of file patterns to exclude when copying assets from source for bundling. Default: - Empty list
        :param asset_hash: (experimental) Specify a custom hash for this asset. If ``assetHashType`` is set it must be set to ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``. For consistency, this custom hash will be SHA256 hashed and encoded as hex. The resulting hash will be the asset hash. NOTE: the hash is used in order to identify a specific revision of the asset, and used for optimizing and caching deployment activities related to this asset such as packaging, uploading to Amazon S3, etc. If you chose to customize the hash, you will need to make sure it is updated every time the asset changes, or otherwise it is possible that some deployments will not be invalidated. Default: - Based on ``assetHashType``
        :param asset_hash_type: (experimental) Determines how asset hash is calculated. Assets will get rebuild and uploaded only if their hash has changed. If asset hash is set to ``SOURCE`` (default), then only changes to the source directory will cause the asset to rebuild. This means, for example, that in order to pick up a new dependency version, a change must be made to the source tree. Ideally, this can be implemented by including a dependency lockfile in your source tree or using fixed dependencies. If the asset hash is set to ``OUTPUT``, the hash is calculated after bundling. This means that any change in the output will cause the asset to be invalidated and uploaded. Bear in mind that ``pip`` adds timestamps to dependencies it installs, which implies that in this mode Python bundles will *always* get rebuild and uploaded. Normally this is an anti-pattern since build Default: AssetHashType.SOURCE By default, hash is calculated based on the contents of the source directory. This means that only updates to the source will cause the asset to rebuild.
        :param build_args: (experimental) Optional build arguments to pass to the default container. This can be used to customize the index URLs used for installing dependencies. This is not used if a custom image is provided. Default: - No build arguments.
        :param bundling_file_access: (experimental) Which option to use to copy the source files to the docker container and output files back. Default: - BundlingFileAccess.BIND_MOUNT
        :param command_hooks: (experimental) Command hooks. Default: - do not run additional commands
        :param image: (experimental) Docker image to use for bundling. If no options are provided, the default bundling image will be used. Dependencies will be installed using the default packaging commands and copied over from into the Lambda asset. Default: - Default bundling image.
        :param output_path_suffix: (experimental) Output path suffix: the suffix for the directory into which the bundled output is written. Default: - 'python' for a layer, empty string otherwise.
        :param poetry_include_hashes: (experimental) Whether to export Poetry dependencies with hashes. Note that this can cause builds to fail if not all dependencies export with a hash. Default: Hashes are NOT included in the exported ``requirements.txt`` file

        :param log_retention_retry_options: When log retention is specified, a custom resource attempts to create the CloudWatch log group. These options control the retry policy when interacting with CloudWatch APIs. Default: - Default AWS SDK retry options.
        :param log_retention_role: The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. Default: - A new role is created.
        :param memory_size: The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param params_and_secrets: Specify the configuration of Parameters and Secrets Extension. Default: - No Parameters and Secrets Extension
        :param profiling: Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param runtime_management_mode: Sets the runtime management configuration for a function's version. Default: Auto
        :param security_groups: The list of security groups to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroup prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param snap_start: Enable SnapStart for Lambda Function. SnapStart is currently supported only for Java 11, 17 runtime Default: - No snapstart
        :param timeout: The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
        :param tracing: Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. This is required when ``vpcSubnets`` is specified. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. This requires ``vpc`` to be specified in order for interfaces to actually be placed in the subnets. If ``vpc`` is not specify, this will raise an error. Note: Internet access for Lambda Functions requires a NAT Gateway, so picking public subnets is not allowed (unless ``allowPublicSubnet`` is set to ``true``). Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param max_event_age: The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing. Minimum: 60 seconds Maximum: 6 hours Default: Duration.hours(6)
        :param on_failure: The destination for failed invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param on_success: The destination for successful invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param retry_attempts: The maximum number of times to retry when the function returns an error. Minimum: 0 Maximum: 2 Default: 2

        :param adot_instrumentation: Specify the configuration of AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) instrumentation. Default: - No ADOT instrumentation
        :param allow_all_outbound: Whether to allow the Lambda to send all network traffic. If set to false, you must individually add traffic rules to allow the Lambda to connect to network targets. Default: true
        :param allow_public_subnet: Lambda Functions in a public subnet can NOT access the internet. Use this property to acknowledge this limitation and still place the function in a public subnet. Default: false
        :param architecture: The system architectures compatible with this lambda function. Default: Architecture.X86_64
        :param code_signing_config: Code signing config associated with this function. Default: - Not Sign the Code
        :param current_version_options: Options for the ``lambda.Version`` resource automatically created by the ``fn.currentVersion`` method. Default: - default options as described in ``VersionOptions``
        :param dead_letter_queue: The SQS queue to use if DLQ is enabled. If SNS topic is desired, specify ``deadLetterTopic`` property instead. Default: - SQS queue with 14 day retention period if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is ``true``
        :param dead_letter_queue_enabled: Enabled DLQ. If ``deadLetterQueue`` is undefined, an SQS queue with default options will be defined for your Function. Default: - false unless ``deadLetterQueue`` is set, which implies DLQ is enabled.
        :param dead_letter_topic: The SNS topic to use as a DLQ. Note that if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is set to ``true``, an SQS queue will be created rather than an SNS topic. Using an SNS topic as a DLQ requires this property to be set explicitly. Default: - no SNS topic
        :param description: A description of the function. Default: - No description.
        :param environment: Key-value pairs that Lambda caches and makes available for your Lambda functions. Use environment variables to apply configuration changes, such as test and production environment configurations, without changing your Lambda function source code. Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param ephemeral_storage_size: The size of the function’s /tmp directory in MiB. Default: 512 MiB
        :param events: Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param function_name: A name for the function. Default: - AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the function's name. For more information, see Name Type.
        :param initial_policy: Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param layers: A list of layers to add to the function's execution environment. You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code during initialization in the form of layers. Layers are packages of libraries or other dependencies that can be used by multiple functions. Default: - No layers.
        :param log_retention: The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE
