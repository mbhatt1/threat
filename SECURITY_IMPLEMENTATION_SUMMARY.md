# Security Implementation Summary - AI Security Audit Framework

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive security enhancements implemented to align CDK infrastructure with application code while raising the security bar for the AI Security Audit Framework.

## 1. Infrastructure-Code Alignment Fixes

### Missing Components Added to CDK
- **Lambda Functions** (7 added):
  - Attack Path Analysis Lambda
  - Conditional Trigger Lambda  
  - Learning Lambda
  - CloudWatch Insights Lambda
  - Security Lake Lambda
  - Slack/Teams Lambda
  - SNS Handler Lambda

- **ECS Agents** (7 added):
  - Dependency Checker Agent
  - IaC Scanner Agent
  - Red Team Simulator Agent
  - SAST Scanner Agent
  - Secrets Scanner Agent
  - Bedrock SAST Agent
  - Container Scanner Agent

## 2. Security Enhancements Implemented

### 2.1 Encryption Improvements
- **KMS Customer-Managed Keys**: Replaced S3_MANAGED encryption with KMS encryption for all S3 buckets and DynamoDB tables
- **Encryption at Rest**: Enabled for all data stores including EFS, RDS (if used), and Lambda environment variables
- **Encryption in Transit**: Enforced SSL/TLS for all API communications

### 2.2 Network Security
- **Security Groups**: Hardened with restrictive ingress/egress rules
- **VPC Endpoints**: Added for S3, DynamoDB, ECR, CloudWatch, and other AWS services
- **Network Segmentation**: Properly isolated compute resources in private subnets
- **High Availability**: Increased NAT Gateways from 1 to 2 for redundancy

### 2.3 IAM Security
- **Least Privilege**: Removed all wildcard (*) permissions and implemented granular policies
- **Role Boundaries**: Added permission boundaries to prevent privilege escalation
- **Service-Specific Roles**: Created dedicated roles for each service component

### 2.4 AWS Security Services Stack
Created comprehensive `security_services_stack.py` with:

#### CloudTrail
- Multi-region trail with file validation
- Encrypted logs with KMS
- CloudWatch Logs integration
- S3 data event logging

#### GuardDuty
- Threat detection enabled
- S3 protection enabled
- Kubernetes audit logs monitoring
- Malware protection for EC2

#### Security Hub
- Centralized security findings
- CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark enabled
- AWS Foundational Security Best Practices enabled
- Automated compliance checking

#### AWS Config
- Configuration recording for all resources
- Compliance rules for:
  - Required tags
  - S3 bucket public access
  - SSL requirements
  - EC2 instances in VPC

#### Amazon Macie
- Data classification for S3 buckets
- PII detection custom identifier
- Scheduled classification jobs

#### AWS Backup
- Automated backup plans with multiple retention periods:
  - Daily backups (7 days retention)
  - Weekly backups (30 days retention)
  - Monthly backups (365 days retention)
- Tag-based resource selection
- Encrypted backup vault

#### WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- Rate limiting protection
- SQL injection protection
- Known bad inputs blocking
- Common attack protection
- IP reputation filtering
- Geographic blocking capability

#### Additional Security Components
- **Custom API Authorizer**: Lambda function for API authentication
- **ECR Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning for container images
- **X-Ray Tracing**: Distributed tracing enabled across services
- **Security Dashboard**: CloudWatch dashboard for security metrics

## 3. Application Security Improvements

### 3.2 Container Security
- ECR scanning on push enabled
- Fargate runtime protection
- Read-only root filesystem
- Non-root user execution

### 3.3 Secrets Management
- Secrets Manager integration
- KMS encryption for secrets
- Automatic rotation capability

## 4. Monitoring and Compliance

### 4.1 CloudWatch Dashboards
- Security services dashboard
- API metrics dashboard
- Lambda performance dashboard
- ECS cluster monitoring

### 4.2 Alarms and Notifications
- High severity finding alerts
- Failed authentication attempts
- Resource compliance violations
- Backup job failures

### 4.3 Audit and Compliance
- CloudTrail for all API calls
- Config for resource compliance
- Security Hub for consolidated findings
- Automated remediation workflows

## 5. Disaster Recovery

### 5.1 Backup Strategy
- Automated daily, weekly, and monthly backups
- Cross-region backup replication capability
- Point-in-time recovery for databases
- Lifecycle policies for cost optimization

### 5.2 High Availability
- Multi-AZ deployments
- Auto-scaling for compute resources
- Load balancing for APIs
- Redundant NAT Gateways

## 6. Next Steps and Recommendations

### 6.1 Immediate Actions
1. Deploy the security services stack
2. Enable MFA for all IAM users
3. Review and approve WAF rules
4. Configure Security Hub custom insights

### 6.2 Short-term (1-3 months)
1. Implement automated remediation for common findings
2. Set up security training for development team
3. Conduct penetration testing
4. Implement SIEM integration

### 6.3 Long-term (3-6 months)
1. Achieve compliance certifications (SOC2, ISO 27001)
2. Implement zero-trust architecture
3. Advanced threat modeling
4. ML-based anomaly detection

## 7. Cost Considerations

Estimated monthly costs for security services:
- GuardDuty: ~$50-200 (based on volume)
- Security Hub: ~$0.001 per finding
- Config: ~$0.003 per configuration item
- Macie: ~$1 per GB scanned
- WAF: ~$5 + $0.60 per million requests
- Backup: Storage costs + $0.05 per GB restored

## 8. Deployment Instructions

```bash
# Deploy all stacks including security services
cd security-audit-framework/cdk
cdk deploy --all

# Or deploy security services stack specifically
cdk deploy AISecurityAudit-SecurityServices
```
