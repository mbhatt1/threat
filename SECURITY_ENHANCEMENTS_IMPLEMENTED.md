# Security Enhancements Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document details the security enhancements implemented for the AI Security Audit Framework to align the CDK infrastructure with security best practices and ensure all application components are properly deployed.

## Infrastructure Security Enhancements

### 1. KMS Encryption Implementation ✅
**File**: `cdk/stacks/storage_stack.py`

#### Changes Made:
- Added customer-managed KMS key with automatic rotation
- Updated all S3 buckets to use KMS encryption instead of S3_MANAGED
- Updated all DynamoDB tables to use CUSTOMER_MANAGED encryption
- Enforced SSL/TLS for all S3 buckets
- Granted CloudWatch Logs access to KMS key for encrypted logging

#### Security Benefits:
- Encryption at rest with customer-controlled keys
- Automatic key rotation every 365 days
- Centralized key management and audit trail
- Protection against unauthorized access to data

### 2. Network Security Hardening ✅
**File**: `cdk/stacks/network_stack.py`

#### Changes Made:
- Increased NAT Gateways from 1 to 2 for high availability
- Added isolated subnet tier for sensitive workloads
- Changed security groups from `allow_all_outbound=True` to `allow_all_outbound=False`
- Added specific egress rules for:
  - HTTPS to VPC (10.0.0.0/8)
  - HTTPS to S3 via prefix list
  - HTTPS to AWS APIs (restricted)
  - DNS resolution (UDP 53)
- Added VPC endpoints for Bedrock, SSM, and KMS

#### Security Benefits:
- Restricted outbound traffic prevents data exfiltration
- Network segmentation isolates workloads
- VPC endpoints keep traffic within AWS network
- High availability prevents single points of failure

### 3. IAM Least Privilege Implementation ✅
**File**: `cdk/stacks/iam_stack.py`

#### Changes Made:
- Replaced wildcard (*) resources with specific ARNs:
  - ECR: Limited to specific repository patterns
  - EFS: Scoped to file system ARNs with access point conditions
  - Secrets Manager: Limited to specific secret prefixes
  - Security Hub: Scoped to regional resources
  - SNS: Limited to security-related topics
  - SES: Restricted to verified identities
- Added IAM policy conditions:
  - Regional restrictions
  - Source address validation
  - Service-specific conditions
- Scoped permissions to minimum required actions

#### Security Benefits:
- Prevents privilege escalation
- Limits blast radius of compromised credentials
- Enables granular access control
- Improves audit and compliance posture

## Application Code Alignment

### 4. Missing Lambda Functions Added ✅
**File**: `cdk/stacks/lambda_stack.py`

   - Memory: 512 MB, Timeout: 5 minutes

3. **Learning Lambda**

   - Improves detection accuracy over time
   - Memory: 2048 MB, Timeout: 15 minutes

### 5. Missing ECS Agents Deployed ✅
**File**: `cdk/stacks/ecs_stack.py`

#### Agents Added:
1. **Dependency Scanner**
   - Scans for vulnerable dependencies
   - CPU: 2048, Memory: 4096 MB

2. **Infrastructure as Code Scanner**
   - Analyzes Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.
   - CPU: 1024, Memory: 2048 MB

3. **Red Team Agent**
   - Simulates attacks (safe mode by default)
   - CPU: 2048, Memory: 4096 MB

4. **SAST Agent**
   - Static Application Security Testing
   - CPU: 2048, Memory: 4096 MB

5. **Secrets Scanner**
   - Detects exposed credentials
   - CPU: 1024, Memory: 2048 MB

6. **Bedrock SAST Agent**
   - AI-powered code analysis
   - CPU: 4096, Memory: 8192 MB

7. **Container Scanner**
   - Vulnerability scanning for containers
   - CPU: 2048, Memory: 4096 MB

## Additional Security Controls

### 6. Monitoring and Logging
- CloudWatch Container Insights enabled for ECS
- VPC Flow Logs enabled for all traffic
- Lambda Insights added for performance monitoring
- Encrypted CloudWatch Logs with KMS

### 7. Data Protection
- S3 bucket versioning enabled
- Point-in-time recovery for DynamoDB
- Automated backups for EFS
- Lifecycle policies for cost optimization

### 8. High Availability
- Multi-AZ deployment
- Multiple NAT Gateways
- ECS Fargate Spot capacity for cost optimization
- Auto-scaling capabilities

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Update AWS credentials and region settings
- [ ] Verify all Docker images build successfully
- [ ] Create required Secrets Manager entries for Git credentials
- [ ] Verify SES sender email is verified
- [ ] Update QuickSight user ARN in Lambda environment

### Deployment Steps
1. Deploy infrastructure:
   ```bash
   cd cdk
   npm install
   cdk bootstrap
   cdk deploy --all
   ```

2. Verify deployments:
   ```bash
   aws ecs list-task-definitions --region <region>
   aws lambda list-functions --region <region>
   ```

3. Configure S3 event notifications (post-deployment):
   ```bash
   aws s3api put-bucket-notification-configuration \
     --bucket <results-bucket> \
     --notification-configuration file://s3-notifications.json
   ```

### Post-Deployment Security Verification
- [ ] Verify KMS key is created and encryption is active
- [ ] Test security group rules are restrictive
- [ ] Verify IAM roles follow least privilege
- [ ] Check all Lambda functions are deployed
- [ ] Verify all ECS task definitions exist
- [ ] Test VPC endpoints are functional
- [ ] Validate CloudWatch Logs encryption
