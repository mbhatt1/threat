```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker
- AWS CDK v2

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-security-audit-framework
cd ai-security-audit-framework
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd cdk
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Deploy the infrastructure:
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Usage

#### Trigger a scan via SNS:
```bash
aws sns publish \
  --topic-arn <SNS_TOPIC_ARN> \
  --message '{
    "repository_url": "https://github.com/example/repo",
    "branch": "main",
    "scan_options": {
      "deep_analysis": true,
      "auto_remediate": false
    }
  }'
```

#### Trigger via API:
```bash
curl -X POST https://<API_GATEWAY_URL>/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "repository_url": "https://github.com/example/repo",
    "branch": "main"
  }'
```

## 📊 Output

The framework generates:
- Comprehensive security findings with AI-powered insights
- Attack chain visualizations
- Risk scores and prioritization
- AI-generated remediation plans
- Executive summaries
- Compliance mappings

Results are stored in S3 and can be viewed via:
- AWS QuickSight dashboards
- API queries
- Direct S3 access

## 💰 Cost Optimization & Performance Management

The framework includes HASHIRU (Heuristic Analysis and Strategic Hierarchical Intelligence for Resource Utilization) which:

### Cost Optimization
- Monitors real-time AWS costs via Cost Explorer
- Predicts scan costs before execution
- Optimizes resource allocation (CPU/Memory)
- Uses spot instances where possible (up to 70% savings)

### Agent Performance Management
HASHIRU now actively manages agent performance by:

#### Performance Tracking
- **Accuracy Monitoring**: Tracks true positive vs false positive rates
- **Execution Time**: Monitors if agents meet expected completion times
- **Quality Scoring**: Evaluates the quality of security findings
- **Historical Analysis**: Maintains performance history in DynamoDB

#### Employment Decisions
Agents are automatically evaluated and can be:
- **Promoted**: Top performers get more resources and higher priority
- **Retained**: Good performers continue normally
- **Warned**: Single performance issue triggers monitoring
- **Probation**: Multiple issues result in reduced priority
- **Fired**: Consistently poor performers are disabled

#### Performance Thresholds
- Minimum 85% accuracy required
- Maximum 15% false positive rate
- Must complete within 2x expected time
- Minimum 0.7 quality score for findings

#### Resource Allocation
- Top performers receive 50% more CPU and memory
- Underperformers get reduced priority in task queues
- "Fired" agents are automatically excluded from scans

Example metrics stored for each agent:
```json
{
  "agent_type": "SAST",
  "accuracy": 0.92,
  "false_positive_rate": 0.08,
  "execution_time_ratio": 1.2,
  "quality_score": 0.85,
  "employment_status": "promoted"
}
```

## 🔐 Security

- All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- VPC isolation with private subnets
- IAM roles with least privilege
- Secrets managed via AWS Secrets Manager
- Comprehensive audit logging

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0

```

### Customization

Each agent can be customized by modifying its prompt engineering in the respective agent file:
- `src/agents/bedrock_unified/agent.py`
- `src/agents/autonomous_code_analyzer/agent.py`
- etc.

## 📈 Monitoring

- CloudWatch dashboards for all components
- X-Ray tracing for performance analysis
- Custom metrics for AI agent performance

## ⚡ Why This Approach?

Traditional security tools are limited by:
- Static rules that miss context
- Inability to understand business logic
- False positives from rigid pattern matching
- Lack of adaptability to new threats

Our AI-powered approach:
- Understands code semantically
- Adapts to new threat patterns
- Provides context-aware analysis
- Continuously improves
- Reduces false positives through intelligence

## 🚧 Roadmap

- [ ] Additional AI model support (GPT-4, Llama, etc.)
- [ ] Real-time monitoring mode
- [ ] AI-powered automatic remediation
- [ ] Multi-region deployment
- [ ] IDE plugins for local scanning
