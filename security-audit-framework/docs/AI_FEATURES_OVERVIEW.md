  - Pass 1: General vulnerability scan
  - Pass 2: Language-specific semantic analysis
  - Pass 3: Behavioral pattern detection
  - Pass 4: Cross-reference validation
  - Each pass uses separate Bedrock API calls
  - Results aggregated with confidence scoring
- **Performance**: ~15-30 seconds for full 4-pass analysis

### 10. AI Security Sandbox (`ai_security_sandbox.py`)
- **Purpose**: Simulate vulnerability exploitation in AI-controlled environment
- **Implementation**: Bedrock-based simulation without actual code execution
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /ai-security/sandbox`
- **Technical Details**:
  - AI simulates vulnerability behavior without running code
  - Safe mode ensures no actual exploitation
  - Returns execution results, risk assessment, and containment status
  - All simulation happens within Bedrock model context
- **Limitations**: Cannot test actual runtime behavior, only theoretical exploitation

## AI-Powered CLI

The CLI has been completely revamped with AI features:

```bash
# Run AI security scan
ai-security scan --path . --type incremental

# Explain a finding with AI
ai-security explain <finding_id>

# Create custom policy from natural language
ai-security create-policy "No database queries in frontend code" \
  -e "const data = db.query('SELECT * FROM users')"

# Check package for supply chain risks
ai-security check-package requests --ecosystem python

# View AI model performance stats
ai-security stats --model anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0

SK: scan_id
GSI1-PK: scan_id
GSI1-SK: created_at

GSI2-SK: business_risk_score
```

### Calibration Storage Pattern
```
PK: model
SK: confidence_range_start
